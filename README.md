# Financial Computing
This was my first assigment for the "Financial Computing" module offered in the masters program at Brunel University London. The module was comprised of two terms. The first built up the students understanding and ability to implement mathematical algorithms in C. The second introduced OpenMP and MPI to implement multi-threading and multi-processing algorithms respectively.
